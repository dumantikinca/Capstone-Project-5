# Capstone-Project-5
## Project Details: 
### Description
This program is written in Java language which was created to fulfill the level 2 task requirements for the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in. 
The program is designed to be a project management system for a small structural engineering firm. The company works on various buildings in an engineering capacity to ensure structural integrity. 
The Java program was written to assist the company in keeping track of the many projects that they work on. The program keeps track of project information by writing and saving details of
projects to external text files.
