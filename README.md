# Capstone-Project-5
## Project Details: 
### Description
The Poised Project is a program written the Java language that was created to fulfill the level 2 task requirements for the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in. 
The program is designed to be a project management system for a small structural engineering firm. The company works on various buildings in an engineering capacity to ensure structural integrity. 
The Java program was written to assist the company in keeping track of the many projects that they work on. The program keeps track of project information by writing and saving details of
projects to external text files.

### Contributors
This project was worked on individually by myself for the software engineering bootcamp. 
However, the helpful mentors from Hyperion Development have reviwed the project and commented on it too!
